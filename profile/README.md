# Vibe Code Bar üç∫

Welcome to the Vibe Code Bar üç∫ GitHub organization! We‚Äôre a community of developers exploring 'vibe coding'‚Äîa new approach to programming where AI tools like LLMs handle the code, allowing us to focus on high-level ideas.

## About Us

In the age of AI, programming is evolving. 'Vibe coding,' a term coined by Andrej Karpathy, captures this shift: developers can now 'give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.' At Vibe Code Bar üç∫, we dive into this new paradigm, exploring how AI can accelerate development while maintaining best practices.

Our community focuses on responsible vibe coding, ensuring that developers:
- Understand the AI-generated code they use.
- Create maintainable and extensible software.
- Are prepared to debug and troubleshoot when necessary.
- Prioritize security to prevent vulnerabilities.

## Events

We host in-person 'vibe coding sessions' where developers can ideate, network, and build prototypes or products within hours. Check out our events on Luma (`lu.ma/vibecodebar`) and subscribe to our WhatsApp channel (`wa.me/vibecodebar`) for updates.
